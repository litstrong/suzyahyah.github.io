I am a second year CS PhD student focusing on NLP at Johns Hopkins advised by Professor Kevin Duh. Previously I was advised by Dr Chieu Hai Leong (DSO National Labs) and Professor Steve Renals (University of Edinburgh). 

If you are applying for PhD programmes and

I write for selfish reasons - to crystallise ideas. But if another human should benefit from this, that would be quite fantastic!
