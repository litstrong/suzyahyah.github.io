I am a CS PhD student (2018-) focusing on NLP at Johns Hopkins advised by [Professor Kevin Duh](http://cs.jhu.edu/~kevinduh/). Previously I was advised by [Dr Chieu Hai Leong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hai-leong-chieu-29a95a30/) (DSO National Labs) and [Professor Steve Renals](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/srenals/) (University of Edinburgh). In my previous career I learnt some Human Factors and Social psychology from [Dr. Angela Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-tan-aa67487/) and [Dr. Bernice Khoo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernicekhoo/?originalSubdomain=sg).

I write for selfish reasons - to crystallise ideas. But if another human should benefit from this, that would be quite fantastic!
