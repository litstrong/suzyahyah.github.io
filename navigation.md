The interactive display below provides a graphical overview and navigation for the content in this blog. Each node(circle) represents a post.  A link is drawn between the posts if they belong to the same category.

Possible Actions:
* Click on the link to see the category.
* Mouseover the post to see the post title.
* Click on the node to navigate to the post.
* Bigger nodes are more popular posts. (Rich get richer?)
