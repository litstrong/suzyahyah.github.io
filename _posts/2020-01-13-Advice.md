There is too much yawn-inducing advice on the internet when it comes to the workplace but these may be a little less generic as they emerged more organically and I am glad I noted some of them down 6 years ago.

* Don't mistake hardwork for good work.
* Don't avoid specialisation. The ideal is the "T" shape. Sufficient context(breadth) and depth. 
* Too much work is a happy problem. The problem is when nobody wants to work with you.
* Don't be discouraged for lack of transition, sometimes it comes down to political will. Nothing
you do will ever be wasted. Keep a record of what happened, what should have happened and how
did it go wrong.
* Don't play games. It just wastes everyones times.
* The most important skill to have is problem-solving.
* Don't waste time worrying about the performance appraisal, really, ruminating over one cycle is
sufficient to understand it, and ruminating over two cycles is too much.
* Anything can be done with enough time and effort. But life is short, so don't forget to take
stock.
* Always try to apply what u learnt. You need to stop and internalise this knowledge in order to
act on it.
* I don't know, you don't know, that's fine - we'll learn together.
* Always be closing.
