It’s been some weeks. Some people can deal with it easier than others. Maybe you’re one of the people who can’t. Maybe you’re going through a hard time in your life right now, which makes everything worse. I just want to tell you that it’s ok to feel unproductive, it’s ok to feel lonely, its ok to be worried about your job, its ok to stress about that relationship. Maybe you don’t believe me. We both know I’ll never understand completely, but I care about you.

Do what you can to cope, and seek help if you think you can’t. It’s going to get worse before it gets better, and you are going to get better. 

This post is dedicated to you and me. Also to Jet, who is doing one of the most critical things in his life right now.
