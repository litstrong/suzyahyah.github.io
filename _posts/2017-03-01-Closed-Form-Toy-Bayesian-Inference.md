### Key Concepts
* Bayesian Inference is the use of Bayes theorem to estimate parameters of an unknown probability distribution.
* Bernoulli distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable \$ y \in \\{0, 1\\}\$

### Model Preliminaries

* In Bayes Theorem, 

* TODO: Get the 3 normal curves
