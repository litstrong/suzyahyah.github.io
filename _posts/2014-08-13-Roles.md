Anyone who participates in this system is designated a ‘job’, a place within the system where they should contribute. CEO has worked out an organisational structure etc. Its therefore important to know your role, know what is required for you to perform it, and where you fit in the system. 

Don’t be trying to do someone else’s role. You can learn about it, but don't be trying to do it especially if you don't have access to the information and resources required to perform it. Know your role and know what is required. To be a rockstar, get stuff done. Not talked about, not analyzed, not discussed, but done.
