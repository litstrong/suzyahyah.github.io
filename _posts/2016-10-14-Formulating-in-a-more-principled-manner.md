### Preamble
Coming from a psychological science background, one of the problems I
struggle most with is formulating algorithms in a principled manner.
This is something I have decided to tackle head on. Polya mentor was 
conceptualised to help me get through math with a mobile mentor, without 
needing to constantly cross-reference some chapter in a faraway book. I had 
also gone to see my Professor (who's class I scored a C in and one of the motivations
for this project) on what are the common challenges students have when formulating 
problems into mathematical algorithms.

#### Polya's Problem Solving Approach
Polya describes 4 approaches to solving a problem. 
1. Understanding the problem
- What is the unknown? 
- What are the data? 
- What are the conditions?  
- At the end of this, introduce suitable notation.

2. Finding connections 
- Have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?

3. Carrying out a plan 
- Can you prove that it is correct?

4. Examine the solution 
- Can you derive the result differently?

We will focus on *1. Understanding the problem* for the purpose of introducing suitable notation.
