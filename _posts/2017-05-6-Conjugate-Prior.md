A prior is conjugate to the posterior $P(\pi\|D)$, if the likelihood $P(D\|\pi)$ is of the same family as the prior $p(\pi)$. In Bayesian Inference, this allows us to update the posterior easily with new observations or 'pseudocounts', and draw new model parameters from the updated posterior distribution.
